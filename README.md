# Integrated Health Determinants Experiments

Welcome to the Integrated-Health-Determinants repository, a collaborative repo dedicated to the advancement of holistic health data utilization. This repository serves as a central hub for tools, schemas, and documentation that support the comprehensive capture and use of health determinants data.

## Starting with PRAPARE

We're starting with the popular PRAPARE assessment tool, provided by . The PRAPARE form is a standardized tool used to collect data on the social determinants of health (SDOH), offering insights into the broader context of patients' lives that significantly impact their health outcomes. However the screening tool for the 1115 Waiver will most likely be AHC HRSN by CMS. This folder will be built out to provide the schemas and integration tools for this screening in the future. 

### What We Provide

- **JSON Schema**: We offer a JSON Schema representation of the PRAPARE form, enabling seamless data ingestion and integration from various digital health platforms.
- **XML Schema**: An XML Schema is also available for systems that utilize XML data formats, ensuring compatibility and data integrity.
- **Structured Data Capture Forms**: To facilitate diverse data capture needs, we provide structured forms that can be used in different healthcare information systems.
- **Data Integration Tools**: Tools and guidelines for integrating collected data into existing health records and systems.
- **Reporting Templates**: Predefined templates to assist with the analysis and reporting of the collected data, aiming to inform healthcare decisions and policy-making.

## Goals

- **Data Ingestion**: Simplify the process of entering data from various sources into a centralized system.
- **Data Integration**: Ensure that data from the PRAPARE form can be easily integrated with other health data systems, providing a holistic view of patient health determinants.
- **Data Reporting**: Facilitate the generation of reports that can drive decision-making and influence policy to improve patient outcomes.
